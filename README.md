# Abstract
The increase of social media platforms such as Twitter and Telegram has
transformed communication, enhanced free speech, but also facilitated
the spread of harmful content. This rise in online threats against Dutch
politicians highlights the need to understand online radicalisation pro-
cesses to protect democratic values. This study combines Data Science and
Media Studies to develop a multi-class text classifier aimed at identifying
and classifying phases of radicalisation, based on the staircase to terror-
ism by Moghaddam (2005), in Dutch social media messages. The classifier
achieved an accuracy of 98.91%, surpassing previous models. Precision
varied, with high scores for non-radicalised messages and death threats,
but lower for intermediate phases like dehumanising, demonising, and
violent threats. Here we show that while the classifier excels in identify-
ing non-radicalised messages and death threats, it struggles with nuanced
phases of radicalisation, showed by lower precision scores for intermedi-
ate phases. Our case studies revealed no significant correlation between
tried threats and the distribution of radicalisation phases, although peaks
in messaging corresponded with public events like demonstrations and
COVID-19 press conferences. Future research should explore additional
social media platforms and features like retweets and emoticons to better
understand the dynamics of online radicalisation.
Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to
counteract online threats and safeguard democratic processes. By enhanc-
ing classifier accuracy and exploring broader social media data, we can
better monitor the spread of radicalising content, ensuring that political
discourse remains open and free from intimidation. This research pro-
vides a foundation for advancing and exploring tools to detect and anal-
yse online radicalisation and its different phases. To refine these tools and
improve their capability to identify nuanced patterns in online discourse,
constant efforts have to be made.
